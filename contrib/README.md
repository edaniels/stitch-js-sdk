#### Contribution Guide

### Summary

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/). In general, every release is associated with a tag and a changelog. `master` serves as the mainline branch for the project and represent the latest state of development.

### Publishing a New SDK version
```bash
# run bump_version.bash with either patch, minor, or major
./bump_version.bash <patch|minor|major>

# make live
git push upstream && git push upstream --tags
npm publish
```

### Patch Versions

The work for a patch version should happen on a "support branch" (e.g. 1.2.x). The purpose of this is to be able to support a minor release while excluding changes from the mainstream (`master`) branch. If the changes in the patch are relevant to other branches, including `master`, they should be backported there. The general publishing flow can be followed using `patch` as the bump type in `bump_version`.

### Minor Versions

The general publishing flow can be followed using `minor` as the bump type in `bump_version`.

### Major Versions

The general publishing flow can be followed using `major` as the bump type in `bump_version`. In addition to this, the release on GitHub should be edited for a more readable format of key changes and include any migration steps needed to go from the last major version to this one.

## Local Development

If you are making changes to the sdk and you want to test your new changes on `baas-ui` without the need to make a new release, we recommend using `yalc`. You can find more about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc).

Install with

```shell
yarn global add yalc
```

### Publishing locally

From the shell you can publish to your local repository created by yalc like so

```shell
yalc publish
```

you will be prompted with something similar to this

```shell
baas-admin-sdk@3.15.0-6490a8da published in store.
```

Now you can go to `baas-ui`, the first time you have to run

```shell
yalc add baas-admin-sdk
```

then every time you publish a new version you have to run

```shell
 yalc update baas-admin-sdk && yarn
 ```

 to update your `baas-admin-sdk` dependency.
